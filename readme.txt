Mura IFrame adds the ability to include manage IFrames for Mura CMS.  There is an "Admin" screen for
adding/editing IFrames and a Display Object on the front-end so new IFrames can be drag and dropped
into any Display Region.

This plugin requires Mura 7.x.

Instructions:

This plugin can be installed via the Mura Admin / Global Settings / Plugin screen just like any other plugin.

Once it's installed, you should have an "IFrame" option in your "Plugins" menu.  Here you can add and edit
IFrames that you want to use on yoru site.  This should be pretty straight forward.

On the front-end, you'll have an "IFrame Widget" Display Object.  Drag the IFrame Widget onto any
Display Region on your site, select an IFrame from the drop-down on the right and it should appear. Remember
to click the "Save/Publish" button for that page to save your changes.

Also on the front-end "IFrame Widget", there is an "Add new IFrame" button in the Configurator on the 
right-hand side.  This basically lets you add IFrames the same way the Admin screen does.  If it's
easier to do all of your work from the front-end and add IFrames "as you go", you can do so here.  
The IFrames get stored in the exact same way as if they were added in the Admin screen originally.

Enjoy.
